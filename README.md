When a improvement is ready to be contributed in a pull request, please review the following checklist:

1. Squash your changes into a single clear and thoroughly descriptive commit, split changes into multiple commits only when it contributes to readability
2. Reference the GitHub issue that you are contributing on in your commit title or body
3. Sign your commits, as this is required by the automated GitHub PR checks
4. Ensure that the changes adhere to the project code style and formatting rules by running `npx eslint .` and `npx prettier --check ../` from the `./OwnTube.tv/` directory (without errors/warnings)
5. Include links and illustrations in your pull request to make it easy to review
6. Request a review by @ar9708, @OGTor, @tryklick and @mblomdahl
